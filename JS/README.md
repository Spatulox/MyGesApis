# Projet GesAPI

## Description

The GesAPI project is a (Transpile) TypeScript library (So it's basically JS, with "weird" syntax) that allows interaction with the MyGES API. It is customized based on the myges-cli version by [quantumsheep](https://github.com/quantumsheep/myges-cli).

## Installation

> - Retrieve only the files contained in the JS folder of this Git repository (you should not take the package.json file)
> - Install axios using `npm install axios@1.7.7` (or higher versions).
